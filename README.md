Task 3 - Linear Regression

Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

Dataset
- Housing Price Prediction Dataset
- Features used:
  - area
  - bedrooms
  - bathrooms
  - stories
  - parking

Target variable:
- price

Steps Followed
1. Imported and preprocessed the dataset.
2. Selected numeric features for model training.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
4. Built and trained a Multiple Linear Regression model.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
6. Visualized the results by plotting:
   - Scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted prices.
   - Best-fit trend line on the scatter plot.

Model Performance
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1127483.3523235186
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2292721545725.3613
- R² Score: 0.5464062355495873

Observations
- Most of the predicted prices are close to the actual prices.
- The model performed reasonably well based on the R² score.
- Best-fit line shows a positive linear relationship between actual and predicted values.

Conclusion
Successfully built and evaluated a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.  
Learned how to interpret evaluation metrics and visualize model performance.
